Instructions for executing my script file:

Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your system.
Download the "Assignment2.ipynb" file and save it to a directory of your choice.
Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from the command line or using an IDE like Anaconda Navigator.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the "Assignment2.ipynb" file.
Open the "Assignment2.ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Run the cells in the notebook sequentially by clicking on each cell and pressing Shift+Enter or using the "Run" button.
Ensure that the required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) are installed.
The script will load the dataset "Data_User_Modeling_Dataset_Hamdi Tolga KAHRAMAN.csv" automatically.
[Note: I merged the training data and test data to create one csv file to use in the report]

Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook to understand and execute each part of the script.
